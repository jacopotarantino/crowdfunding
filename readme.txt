== Description ==

Crowdfunding by AppThemer is a funding platform for WordPress. Integrated seamlessly with Easy Digital Downloads, the Crowdfunding plugin lets you crowd source everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology.

"Backers" can pledge specified amounts of money towards a project and receive rewards for their contributions. Pledge amounts are only collected if a campaign reaches its goal in the time specified.

Run your own crowd sourcing website for anything you can imagine.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with any theme? =

Not currently at this time. However, it is very easy to integrate with a theme. There are a few custom templates that need to be set up. Simply create a single-campaign.php, archive-campaigns.php, and single-campaign-backers.php and you are ready to go. These files act like a standard archive or single template in WordPress.
