== Description ==

Crowdfunding by AppThemer is a funding platform for WordPress. An extension that seamlessly integrates with [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/), the Crowdfunding plugin lets you crowd source everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology.

"Backers" can pledge specified amounts of money towards a project and receive rewards for their contributions. Pledge amounts are only collected if a campaign reaches its goal in the time specified.

Run your own crowd funding website for anything you can imagine.

Note: The AppThemer Crowdfunding plugin is designed to work alongside the [PayPal Adaptive Payments gateway](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/paypal-adaptive-payments/?ref=7) so that pledges are collected but no funds are taken until the campaign reaches its goal. The plugin will also work along side any other gateway that Easy Digital Downloads supports but funds will be taken immediately.

**FEATURES**

Features of the plugin include:

* Crowd fund anything you want!
* Compatible with [PayPal Adaptive Payments API](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/paypal-adaptive-payments/?ref=7) for pre-approved purchases. When a person commits to funding your project they are only charged if your campaign reaches its pre-defined goal.
* Compatible with all standard payment gateways that Easy Digital Downloads supports, i.e [Stripe](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/stripe-payment-gateway/?ref=7), [PayPal Pro/Express](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/paypal-pro-express/?ref=7).
* Works both as a donation plugin and a Crowdfunding plugin.
* Easy to theme and integrate into your own site which uses [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Does this plugin work with any theme?**

Not currently at this time. However, it is very easy to integrate with a theme. There are a few custom templates that need to be set up. Simply create a single-campaign.php, archive-campaigns.php, and single-campaign-backers.php and you are ready to go. These files act like a standard archive or single template in WordPress.
